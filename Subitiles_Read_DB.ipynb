God has helped us all our lives.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n228\\\\r\\\\n00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:57,664\\\\r\\\\nBut it fell...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n229\\\\r\\\\n00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:01,151\\\\r\\\\nit could not even help itself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n230\\\\r\\\\n00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,647\\\\r\\\\nWhat talk have you been listening to?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n231\\\\r\\\\n00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:07,743\\\\r\\\\nThe real god is unseen.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n232\\\\r\\\\n00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,490\\\\r\\\\nHe\\\\\\'s not made of clay.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n233\\\\r\\\\n00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:17,873\\\\r\\\\nAmmar, we see the gods\\\\r\\\\nin the Kaaba every day.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n234\\\\r\\\\n00:24:19,262 --> 00:24:20,391\\\\r\\\\nI\\\\\\'m afraid for

00:24:29,042\\\\r\\\\nI\\\\\\'m listening to Muhammad, mother.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n237\\\\r\\\\n00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:31,699\\\\r\\\\nMuhammad is generous, yes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n238\\\\r\\\\n00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,417\\\\r\\\\nHe gives, he shares,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n239\\\\r\\\\n00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:35,835\\\\r\\\\nhe\\\\\\'ll pass no man without a smile,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n240\\\\r\\\\n00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,471\\\\r\\\\nbut he is spreading dangerous ideas.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n241\\\\r\\\\n00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:43,078\\\\r\\\\nDangerous ideas,\\\\r\\\\nthat no man should start?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n242\\\\r\\\\n00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:47,103\\\\r\\\\nThat the rich should not afloat the poor?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n243\\\\r\\\\n00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,140\\\\r\\\\nThe strong should not oppress the weak?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n244\\\\r\\\\n00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,379\\\\r\\\\nAre these dangerous ideas?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n245\\\\r\\\\n00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:54,575\\\\r\\\\nGirls should not be forced into marriage,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n246\\\\r\\\\n00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:56,783\\\\r\\\\nbut be able to choose or refuse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n247\\\\r\\\\n00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,080\\\\r\\\\nBy only tonight, he said;\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n248\\\\r\\\\n00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:03,386\\\\r\\\\nStop the burial of new-born girls.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n249\\\\r\\\\n00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:09,031\\\\r\\\\nI was fortunate, always\\\\r\\\\nfortunate with your mother.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n250\\\\r\\\\n00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,364\\\\r\\\\nYes, but you know that you and I\\\\r\\\\nnearly never met, Yasser.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n251\\\\r\\\\n00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:19,311\\\\r\\\\nAnd you were nearly never born.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n252\\\\r\\\\n00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:23,067\\\\r\\\\nI was to be buried,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n253\\\\r\\\\n00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,383\\\\r\\\\nlike my two sisters,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n254\\\\r\\\\n00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:29,409\\\\r\\\\nbut my father couldn\\\\\\'t do it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n255\\\\r\\\\n00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:33,116\\\\r\\\\nHe couldn\\\\\\'t do it the third time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n256\\\\r\\\\n00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:38,580\\\\r\\\\nWhen the second girl was being...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n257\\\\r\\\\n00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:45,284\\\\r\\\\nwhen my father was putting sand over her,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n258\\\\r\\\\n00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:51,038\\\\r\\\\nshe took hold of his finger,\\\\r\\\\nthe way a baby does.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n259\\\\r\\\\n00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,614\\\\r\\\\nHe told my mother afterwards,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n260\\\\r\\\\n00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:56,812\\\\r\\\\nthat it was a minute...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n261\\\\r\\\\n00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,617\\\\r\\\\nbefore the tender little grip eased...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n262\\\\r\\\\n00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,583\\\\r\\\\nand he dared take away his hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n263\\\\r\\\\n00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:11,866\\\\r\\\\nWhen I was born,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n264\\\\r\\\\n00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,253\\\\r\\\\nmy father ran out of the house\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n265\\\\r\\\\n00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:17,330\\\\r\\\\nscreaming that he couldn\\\\\\'t do it again,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n266\\\\r\\\\n00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,448\\\\r\\\\nthat he could never do it again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n267\\\\r\\\\n00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:25,033\\\\r\\\\nSumayyah, it is the custom.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n268\\\\r\\\\n00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:26,911\\\\r\\\\nBut it\\\\\\'s wrong.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n269\\\\r\\\\n00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:32,116\\\\r\\\\nThe gods that let such\\\\r\\\\nthings be are no gods.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n270\\\\r\\\\n00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:37,280\\\\r\\\\nI promised to go to Muhammad\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nhouse mama, we pray there.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n271\\\\r\\\\n00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,807\\\\r\\\\nYes! He is a good man.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n272\\\\r\\\\n00:26:46,631 --> 00:26:49,737\\\\r\\\\nYes...\\\\r\\\\nyes, you go.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n273\\\\r\\\\n00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,478\\\\r\\\\nTwo men are following him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n274\\\\r\\\\n00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,814\\\\r\\\\nRead? Muhammad can\\\\r\\\\nneither write nor read.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n275\\\\r\\\\n00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:13,893\\\\r\\\\nBut he can speak.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n276\\\\r\\\\n00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:17,160\\\\r\\\\nWhat did you say?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n277\\\\r\\\\n00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:19,068\\\\r\\\\nHe can speak?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n278\\\\r\\\\n00:27:19,977 --> 00:27:22,964\\\\r\\\\nWell, so can you so now,\\\\r\\\\nyou speak up young man.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n279\\\\r\\\\n00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:25,222\\\\r\\\\nWhat does Muhammad say, umm?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n280\\\\r\\\\n00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:27,869\\\\r\\\\nThey are God\\\\\\'s words, not his.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n281\\\\r\\\\n00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:30,596\\\\r\\\\nWhich god\\\\\\'s?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n282\\\\r\\\\n00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:33,492\\\\r\\\\nWhat words?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n283\\\\r\\\\n00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,070\\\\r\\\\nA speaking god?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n284\\\\r\\\\n00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,634\\\\r\\\\nYour Muhammad\\\\r\\\\nspeaks only to himself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n285\\\\r\\\\n00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:47,039\\\\r\\\\nWhen God reveals His\\\\r\\\\nmessage to Muhammad,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n286\\\\r\\\\n00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:48,237\\\\r\\\\nhe remembers every word\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n287\\\\r\\\\n00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:49,736\\\\r\\\\nthen he tells it to those who can write...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n288\\\\r\\\\n00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:51,694\\\\r\\\\nthis is the Quran.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n289\\\\r\\\\n00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:55,330\\\\r\\\\nMuhammad has starved\\\\r\\\\nhimself into dreams.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n290\\\\r\\\\n00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,567\\\\r\\\\nHe hides under a blanket\\\\r\\\\nwith his eyes shut.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n291\\\\r\\\\n00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:01,244\\\\r\\\\nHis eyes are shut\\\\r\\\\nbut his heart is open.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n292\\\\r\\\\n00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:04,241\\\\r\\\\nYou! Kick him for his cleverness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n293\\\\r\\\\n00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:05,700\\\\r\\\\nThere is no purpose in that.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n294\\\\r\\\\n00:28:08,347 --> 00:28:13,052\\\\r\\\\nDoesn\\\\\\'t Muhammad realize, we\\\\r\\\\nlive by giving housing to the gods?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n295\\\\r\\\\n00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:15,589\\\\r\\\\nWe own the Kaaba.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n296\\\\r\\\\n00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,996\\\\r\\\\nEvery year, the tribes of\\\\r\\\\nArabia come here to Mecca\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n297\\\\r\\\\n00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:20,904\\\\r\\\\nto pray and to buy from us.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n298\\\\r\\\\n00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:27,417\\\\r\\\\nNow, were we to replace\\\\r\\\\n300 Gods with just

02:27:27,159\\\\r\\\\n\"God does not like the man who considers\\\\r\\\\nhimself above other men,\" he said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1238\\\\r\\\\n02:27:28,018 --> 02:27:29,856\\\\r\\\\nSo, I laid back and watched him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1239\\\\r\\\\n02:27:30,716 --> 02:27:32,034\\\\r\\\\nSuddenly, he stopped.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1240\\\\r\\\\n02:27:33,113 --> 02:27:36,570\\\\r\\\\nHe stood to his

yearsin the pollution control departmentat saulven.he was in chargeof monitoring the carbon emissionsof the motors.last year,favan tried to fire him twice,and both times, he lost in court.three days after the last judgement,ducret was attacked.his house was searched.the cops declared ita burglary gone wrong.a week later,he resigned from saulven.was ducret the one they were tryingto trap at the villa?he married his partner in then divorced,so catching him with a womanwouldn't do much.are you ok? am i boring you?ducret called the ecologicaltransition office  times last year,without much success.his calls never lastedmore than ten seconds.then suddenly, last month,his call lasted  minutes.who owned the carthat julie casteran was picked up in?the ecological transition office.pollution control andthe ministry of ecology. it fits.that means that ducret and the personwho they entrapped were in contact.so, we just have to talk to ducret.he'll give us the other guy,who will give us favan.they're like dominoes.and we won't have to questioneveryone at ote.we'll pay ducret a visit tomorrow.mr. ducret?it's open.we can't, verner.we don't have a warrant.what? it's our only lead.mr.

forcing you to flee.you think that's the solution?running away?some people aren't courageous.and some people don't knowhow brave they are.mr. ducret, look at the photo.i think she's deadbecause of charles favanbut also because of whatyou found out about saulven.that's impossible to run away from.mrs. casteran is here.good.hello, mrs. casteran.it's julie's motherwho's here.mr. ducret? i'm julie's mother.i was a pollution control expertat saulven,and a year ago,without any good reason,they changed our software.and i realized thatit was altering the data to reflectlower co emissions.so i wrote a reportand alerted management.i thought i would be congratulated.no.from then on,they were looking for...they were lookingfor reasons to fire me!they succeeded. i quit.but...before i left,i sent a copy of my reportto the ecological transition office.to whom?whom?nicolas lebel.i thought that he would alertthe ministry of ecologyor whoever looks into fraud.but nothing.so i called  times,and i got his switchboard  times.and then, about a month ago,he answered.he said he had thought about it,that he had sent my reportto some peoplebut thathe hadn't heard anything yet.he suggested ithad upset quite a few people.did he ask you to testify?yeah.last week, he showed me this.he told me about his night with...the girl.julie.he was terrified.he told me we had to stop,that favan had a long reachand that he wouldn't stop.i was scared too.multimedia messagei never saw his face.yes?it's not going to be a good dayfor you, mr. lebel.i know about the villaand the young woman, so...i'm the only one who can protectyou from favan.that's the good news.look out the window.shall we meet downstairs?making them spit it out.that's what i like best.ok, julien,all we know about the murderis that the manjulie spent the night with,according to ducret,is lebel, and thathe may have called the cops himself.you have to play with his emotions,remorse...and guilt, yeah.guilt, that's...verner.i know you would preferto be in my place,but we need this interviewto be admissible in court,and you're not a cop anymore,so you should let me handle it.excuse me.childish, don't you think?is he trying to take over the unit?this is no time for cockfights.and i'm the head of the unit.hello, mr. lebel. have a seat.do you knowthis license plate number?it's registeredto the ecological transition office.my job responsibilitiesdon't include license plate numbers.this is the vehicle julie casterangot into the night you met.did you know there were camerasall over the villa?no?because you look good on camera.no.he's making him thinkwe have a copy of the video.this is going to turn against him,turn against you.mr. franck ducret told usabout the carbon emissions fraudat saulven.he wrote a report about it.he says he sent it to you.so, what do you say?you decide to alert the authorities,but nothing happened.we have a record of your callto ducret.and then favan finds a wayto keep you quiet.mr. lebel, you're going to haveto talk to us at some point.a young woman is dead.and somehow,you're connected to all this.you're telling me that a guyi've never mettold you that he sent mea document that i never received,and i'm implicated in the deathof a young woman i've never met?julien, listen to me, please. stop.you have to stopand go back to what you know.his emotions. show himthe crime scene photosand try...we found the caryou were driving that night.it's in the labwith the forensics team,who are analyzing the gps tracker.no!a tracker?no, there is none. he's lying,and now he's going to get it.and if we discover that that carwent from the crime sceneto your home,then things are goingto get complicated for you.do you understand what i'm saying?ok.you're right.he's overthinking this.you're right. i met the girl.she brought me to the villa.i spent the night with her.we drank a little or a lot.at one point,she got up from the sofa,fell, and hit her head on the table.just like that?i don't know.when i saw she wasn't movingand all the blood,i panicked and ran away.when i got back to paris,i bought a sim card in barbesand called the police. i pretendedto be a neighbor.he's taking all the blame.i was scared.he's scared to death.i should have turned myself in.it was an accident.he's not talkingabout the report or favan.if you don't want him to be childish,stop treating him like a child.julien, keep going.it's not that bad.stop mothering him.ok, julien, listen to me.that's great, you got him to admitthat he wasat the villa, but we don't haveanything on favan or the report.so please,go back to what you know.show him the fucking photos.it's obvious that this wasno accidental fall.think, damn it!you said it was an accidental fall.so, can you explain to mehow the lamp, the picture frame,and the broken champagne glassended up on the ground?that's a lot for a fall.don't you think?all right, fine.so, i think that...i think that you foundone of the cameras.you got me a cop who stutters?it's stress.you realized that you were beingset up, and it got out of hand.so maybe julie casteranfell by accident,or maybe you killed her.move to the victim.speaking of...the victim.julien, listen to me. do you hear me?julien, we're not auditioning you,ok?trust yourself.let's talk about the victim.all that blood you mentioned.i imagine that was the first timeyou've seen that much blood.i want a lawyer, please.the blood,the blood,the blood. it doesn't fit.help me, please.what an idiot! i'm an idiot.turn off the camera. i'm going in.excuse me?turn the cameras off. i'm going in.i should have realized earlier.it's a drop.look at this. it's a drop.it's not a trail or a splashor a streak. it's a drop.a drop falls from above.the victim had to be standing.she got up after she fell.i swear she didn't get up.she was lying there, on the ground.that's why i panicked.so she got up after you left.but she was alive.maybe you're not the onewho killed her.the guys who came to finish the jobwere interrupted by the policethat you called.who are the guys who set you up?mr. lebel, that camera is turned off,so whatever you saywill stay between us.at the moment, you are guiltyof neglecting a person in danger.that's five years.if you continue to protect the peoplewho framed you, you're an accomplice.now, we're at  years.there you go, mr. lebel.you need to decidewho is more important.soon, it will be too late.no, but...his lawyers will know it was me.whose lawyers?whose lawyers?come on, give it up.favan.they'll know,and they'll come for my family,me, even if i am in jail.no, not if it's out of court.if the fileon the tampered enginesmagically reappears,through an anonymous source,he'll be fine.you'll be fine, mr. lebel.mr. lebel, if they are tryingto get to you,it's because you still have it.in a safe deposit box,at the bank, at your lawyer's office?no.i hid it in my office.so the girl is deadbecause of this report?, people die every yearbecause of pollution.saulven automobile generatesfour billion in sales a year.imagine favan sittingon a big pile of money.makes more sense now, huh?not really.police. the keysto mr. lebel's office, please.thank you.emissions reportsaulven automobileswe can use this reportto get at favan,but we have nothing on the murder.we need that video.we have no idea what's on it.he must have kept it.it's the only thing he has on lebel.lebel, who is a threat to his empire.we have to isolate favan.he'll make a mistake eventually.should i call him in?hello, is this mr. favan's office?yes, do you have an appointment?he's here!excuse me. you can't just walk in.mr. favan!hello, mr. favan.this is a summons.hey.i was in the neighborhood.you look good! it's good to see you.see you

appreciate your punctuality.have a seat.oh, quite a fall.no lawyer?no.honestly, this doesn't warrant one.what is this anyway?emissions reportsaulven automobileshere you are.in effect...oh, wow.you can imagine thatif i had been aware of this report,the safety of our citizenswould have beensaulven automobile's priority. but...unfortunately, i don't controlproduction personally.you may not control them,but you are responsible for them.you know the methodsand the results.no, wait,this report implicates saulvenas a legal entity.so saulven has to answerfor this, not me.you will have plenty of timeto defend yourself, mr. favan.in the meantime, i'm going to referthis matter to the judgefor fraud, accessory to fraud,issuing false certificates,and negligence that could leadto serious physical injury.that's great. perfect.how combative!what flair!it's such a shame thatyou're no longeron the force. what happened?a nervous breakdown,a case of burnout,like so many of your colleagues?may i have a copy of this report?i'd like to takethe necessary measures,be as vigilant as possible.thank you, mr.... mr. who?verner.verner...i had a geography teachernamed verner in sixth grade.no, it's not funny.he killed himself.excuse me. thank you, mr. verner.thank you, madam prosecutor.i'm going to searchevery corner of your life,in every drawerand under every rug.i'm going to question everyone.your neighbors, your family,your friends,everyone you stepped onto get to this point,everyone you harmed.i'm going to rewindthrough every minute, every hour.i'm going to trace your every step.i'll be likethe fly on your shoulder.and one day,your wife will doubt a memory,some tiny detail,and she'll call me.i'm afraid he doesn't like me much.your office is very small.how long have you had this job?a month?yes.thank you.escort this gentlemanto the waiting room, please.i have a few things to discusswith the judge.come with me.thank you.hello? can everyone hear me?yes.yes.i can hear you.i'm going to go for it, you know.do you know whatparamedics call motorcycles?no.organ donors.favan is textingthe encrypted totem phone.take care of the package.julien, are you in position?i've got eyes on him.totem is on the move. i'm on him.go, go!verner, can you hear me?yes, i hear you.totem is heading west on the a.looks like he's headed to favan's.police!good job, ma'am.hands behind your back! microwave!phone.here.go!it's : p.m.you're under arrestfor witness tamperingand withholding evidence.we have the video and the phone.it's up to you, alice.mr. favan.i've been waiting a long time.if you want my advice,i would strongly advise youto stop while you still can.this investigation is only goingto bring you trouble.please sit down.thank you for your concern.as far as trouble is concerned,we knew what we were getting into.i'm not sure whether to charge youor take you into custody.custody.and how do you plan to do that?that's interesting. i asked myselfthe same question last night.and?andmr. verner gave me my answer.we're going to isolate favan.he'll make a mistake eventually.shall i call him in?hello, mr. favan.this is a summons.hey.i was in the neighborhood.you look good!from there, he has two options.either he'll think we know moreabout the victim,or he'll think we know whyhe set up mr. lebel.he'll come alone,so as not to appear worried,to show us that he's in charge.since it's a simple summons,he'll think that we're here justto advance our pawns.when he arrives,i'll give him the report.as it doesn't concern julie casteran,he'll feel reassured.he'll hide behind saulven automobile,saying something like...this reportimplicates saulven as a legal entity.so saulven has to answerfor this, not me.the usual thing.and then i'll puta little pressure on him.i'm going to searchevery corner of your life,in every drawer and under every rug.what will he think then?he'll think that by lookingfor information about saulven,we might have come across the video.we leave him alone with his phone.he has the right to itsince he came freely.and that's when he will makea mistake.he'll take care of the video first.yeah.he can get outof the pollution story,the

international viewers,hola, bonjour, and konnichiwa.and to our robot viewers,a hearty .i'm chris rose,joined, as always,by fight analyst and mma legend,say hello to kenny florian.chris, thank you so much,i didn't know you spokerobot, that's so cool.yeah, just a little.i remember from highschool and i'm pretty surei just asked the pulverizerwhere the library is.anyway, over the years, battlebotshas truly become a global phenomenon,and this year'stournament is no exception.we've got combatants from acrosseight countries and five continents.that's right, chris.but there's one thingin the battlebots worldthat's the same in everylanguage and it's the giant nut.let's take a look at the teams hoping to kick starttheir championshipjourney tonightwith that all importantfirst win of the season,and this group hassome serious firepower.we'll see the serrated slashercobalt make its return to the battle box.'s most destructivebot award winner, valkyrie,as well as perennial giantnut contender's witchdoctor,and the unburnablebrazilian's black dragon.it's a who's who of thesport's heaviest hitters.we've also got thereturn of some exciting veterans.after taking last season off, halrucker and the indestructible duck!will reenter the battlebox.and for the firsttime since ,grab your earplugs, chris, the combustionking icewave is back in the field.i'm telling ya, no onecould say no to vegas.and, of course, allroads lead to tonight's main eventwhere we will see if theliving legend donald hudsonand lockjaw have theantidote for the vicious biteof last year's numberthree seed, copperhead.this fight is over.but kicking off tonight'saction, we've got a good one.it's the tank thatloves to toss, slammo!throwing down with thealways electric, hypershock.kenny, hypershockled by will balesis one of the most popularteams in the entire competition,and while they've given us plenty ofmemorable moments over the years,they've yet to put togethera memorable season.that's right, this isa team that went toetotoewith bite force in in the round of and nearly pulledoff a magical upset.hypershock has all thetools to become a top tier bot.we'll see if this is the yearthey take the next step.and as for theiropponent, slammo!,they went two and onein the qualifiers last seasonlost to eventualsemifinalist black dragon.this spot, led by craig danby, is lookingto make the leap from middle of the packto legitimate contenders.kenny, you ready toget this thing going?let's do this.are you guys ready as well?i thought so.faruq, take it away.ladies and gentlemen,it's robot fighting time.in the red square, he camefrom miami, and he's here to slam thee.it's hypershock!here we go, team hypershock.will bales mask'sall over the arena.they love this guy.snuck into the tournament lastseason as the number  overall seed.kenny, this spot isn'tjust pretty, it is lethal.that's if everythingis working properly.and that's the biggest if.but listen, willsounds confident.he's got a complete squad, as youcan see running the high five gantlet.i'm expecting hypershock tostick and move, stick and moveand wreak some havoc withthat dual disc vertical spin.in the blue square, fromraleigh, north carolina,being in the ringwith this spot,it's all theslammunition it needs.it's slammo!captain craig danbydraped in the union jack.kenny, slammo!is built like a brick.how does it win thisfight against hypershock?well, slammo!is a powerful grapplerthat looks to controlfights by grabbing, tossing,and disorienting its opponents.it needs to be durable enoughto survive shock from hypershock.ideally, try and breakwill bales' weapon,then look to sweepthat control category.we don't want to have a one anddone, you know, one hit wonder fight.we, we want to have agood back and forth with craig.he has very low forks.he has lots of littleclicketyclackety things.no doubt he's gonna try to getunder us because it's his whole thing.we have to do our darndest tomake sure that doesn't happen.so, we threw out all the oldstuff that wasn't quite right,and we beefed everything up, putbigger parts in, put better parts in,and we think it's gonna be aheavy hitter. it's gonna be great.we are a grabby lift bot and wehave covered our robot this yearin anaglyph dazzle camo.so, if you've got dglasses, it's gonna pop.there's this whole new featurethis year called the upper deck.the plan is to pick up hypershockand throw them on there.and when they get back off, i'mmathrow them back on there again.i'm coming in for the win.i'm always comingin for the win.i'm the sultan of suplex.that's what i'm here for.robots, activate.kenny, look at these twogetting into each other's squares,a little bit of gamesmanshipright off the bat.oh, excited for this one, chris.red team, ready?all right. we'regood. go for it.i guess, that's why he'swill bales and not just will bail.blue team, ready?i'll hammer, if it's over there.you got this.come in.some tension onthe faces of these captainsboth looking tokick off the nightwith a crucial firstwin of the season.let the bot battle begin.hypershock circlingthe drain on slammo!,able to get underneath with thosefront forks and lands in clean shots.woah. big hit.we are seeing thespeed advantage shot right away.oh, yeah. keep your arms up. take him down. yeah.uhoh. hypershock smotheringslammo! here in the opening stretch.oh, and now backing itdown in the short corner.geez! holy smokes.slammo! trying to staysquared up when hypershock is too fast.oh, no.oh, just ran into thefist, here, of will bales.and then gets slammedinto the rail by will bales,who's going in for more.going in slammo likea lion investigating a kill.hypershock! hypershock!oh, we couldhave a countdown coming.ten...and there it is.danby never knewwhat hit him in this match.hypershock, toofast and too curious.one. and the match's over!kenny, hypershock fastout of the gate, really impressive.they sure were.they kind of circled aroundtheir opponent for a little bit.got the angle and then just attackednonstop, getting underneath them,hitting them hard from the back,hitting them hard from the side.tremendous drivingthere from will bales.and i thought, really theimportant thing was hypershock was groundedthe entire fight,sometimes in years past,we've seen him deliver a shotand then wobbly all over the place.well, i think that'sdue to the new chassis.you see, it's a lot wider.it's a little bit longer.it's gonna giveit better stability.but again, the speed was there.everything was just extremelyimpressive from that team.and i think what we'velearned is if you get knockedinto that short cornernext to the upper deck,if you cannot work your wayout of there, you're gonna be doa.absolutely. theytook full advantage of that.they cornered their opponentand then took them out.will bales.it did the thing.you... you have had enoughof will bales, the funny guy.i mean, it's time for people to starttaking you and hypershock seriously, huh?it's nice to haveeverything working,although, technically the weaponwasn't running at the end,but it clearly did some damage.how does it feel toget a win like that, man?not only do you get a win,but it was an exciting win,kind of a... avintage performance.it's been a little while.it's good. it's nice tobe back in the groove.you know, craig andhis team are wonderful.they're a great robot.respect them greatly.but i've got the bestteam here this year.when are you gonna dye yourhair green like your teammate?well, let's see how it goes.oh, wait a second.how about if youget a top  seed,you'll dye your hairin the round of ?fine, if we get a top seed in the round of ,you can film me dyeing my hair.hey, there we go.will bales has throwndown the gauntlet.congratulationson the fast start.thanks, guys. goodto see you again.you, too.congratulations.we did it.whoa, we did it!i know it is just one win.but you heard him.we made a bet thatif he cracks the top ,i think we're gonna have to throwa poll out there on social media.what color shouldwill bales dye his hairif you have to live upto his end of the bargain?yah, but what are you gonnado? you just had him do a bet.you didn't putyourself on the line.what are we gonnado to your hair?i can't come outhere with pink hair. well, maybe i can. i think it will look nice. match your tie. oh, nice. here we go. let's do it. you know what? i'm in.if will bales is in,chris rose is in. i like it. is kenny florian in?you are unbelievable.no, but you did the bet.i was just sitting here.hey, after a break can pmotor his way to an early season win?or will valkyrie poursugar in his gas tank?find out next on battlebots.we are back on battlebots.that is kenny florian,i am chris rose.up next, we've got a showdownfeaturing valkyrie and p.let's start with captain leannecushing and valkyrie squad.last season, they had their mostsuccessful run yet in battlebots.went all the way to the round of before bowing out against whiplash.no shame in that.kenny, leanne is gaining a reputationfor her tactics and her fight iq.and, oh, yeah, her bot was voted's most destructive as well.that combinationis a winning formula.valkyrie is so versatile withtheir primary weapon options.this team is alwaysplaying chess,looking to countertheir opponent.tonight, they aresquaring off against pcaptained by brandon zelinsky.kenny, i thought therewere significant improvementduring the season out of this robot.that's right,this team was very closeto making thetournament last year,but its wins over smeeand chronos didn't move the dialenough to convince the committee.but brandon is back thisseason with a chip on his shoulderand determined to drivep into the winner's circle.and even though he's facing a highlydangerous opponent here in valkyrie,p has the speed and durabilityto be a menace out there.all right. shouldwe be on upset alert?let's find out andsend it over to faruq.in the red square fromsomerville, massachusetts,this bot is here toragnarock your world.it's valkyrie!team valkyrie alwaysready to put on a show.we talked abouttheir limitless arsenal,so what weapon are theygoing with tonight, kenny?they're debuting a new blade.it's called dr. acula.this blade actually has thes tooth inserted into the bladethat's gonna do chunky damageto a wedge and especially wheels.if valkyrie can out drive p, we shouldsee plenty of metal flying around the box.in the blue square fromhudson, new hampshire,he'll drape a checkeredflag over your closed casting,it's p!all right, kenny, what's it goingto take for p to put the sport on notice?well, a win over valkyriewould be a statement for sure.brandon's givenp the full overhaul.he shortened the chassis,added weight to the wedges,installed somemagnets for stability.the bot's ready. we'llsee if brandon is too.p! p! p! p!we're not in thelittle leagues anymore.we're fighting a real robotwho's a real chance at the nut.if they go shooting inthe air, we're in business.if not, we're probably gonnahave to sit on or under their weaponas long as possible and justgrind away at their weapon to tryand make it thermalshock and fail.valkyrie might be lookingacross the pit and they say,oh, these guys haveno spinning weaponjust a drive, just a lifter.they're gonna be infor a surprise tonight.we've made valkyriestronger with both our driveand our speed at whichour weapon spins up.we were able to save some weightand also get a bitmore shoving powerand stay as fast aswe were last years.we're looking to not get flippedbecause it's going toput us at a disadvantagebecause p is lowerto the ground than us.we sit just under a foottall and they beat us in that,and i'm really worriedthat if we're inverted,we're not gonna have muchto do except for try to recoverand figure out away to flip back over.robots, activate.both teams are locked, loaded,and looking for an excuseto exchange insurance info.red team, ready?blue team, ready?here we go.p and valkyrie, anopening win is so crucial.who wants it more?let the bot battle begin.p under charge againstup under valkyrie in a hurry.oh, that's someserious speed there for p.oh, man.  oh.oh. p not afraidto stick his nose in there... wow! but a wheel is off already.oh.p absorbingsome damage here, chris,but leanne cushingneeds to be careful.p is so much lower thanvalkyrie, getting underneath it at will.ah! look atthat gyroscopic force.valkyrie just danglingthere in the air almost.oh, man!brandon zalinskygetting the lifter involved there.p continues to get low ground anduse that horizontal spinner's energyagainst itself.oh, now it's on fire.that lookslike valkyrie is on fire.it is smoking.and p hasvalkyrie in for it now.leanne cushing warned us.she was worriedabout the scenario.it is spinning out of control.has it lost its weapon?that's the big question,the drive is still working.yep, that fireinside of valkyrie there,could have beenthe weapon motor.now for p, doesit have its drive intact?valkyrie's weapon not workingand it's taking a shotfrom the pulverizer.some friendly fire there, chris.that was valkyrie's pulverizer.oh, another one.just go back.just go back. just, no.stop it. stop it. stop it. stop!okay, seems like there's someserious chaos on team valkyrie's sideof the driver's deck.i think, theywere trying to flip valkyrieright side upusing the pulverizer.risky.labeled the mostdestructive bot a season ago,but right now, theweapon is not active.the drive isn'tworking entirely.major frustration for valkyrie.valkyrie, you got toshow me controlled movement.you hear the ref issuinga warning to valkyrie there.remember p as it continues toengage that can have an effect on enginesending the fight andstopping a countdown, kenny,but p's drive not looking allthat hot at the moment, either.i think it's showing moremovement than valkyrie here.brandon zalinskycontinuing to engage.i think it's struggling because ofthat lack of wheel on that left backsidefifteen seconds left to go.and there's p showing itstill has function in that lifter.this would be a huge upset if pis able to get it doneagainst valkyrie.remember, they were bigtime underdogs coming into this fight.oh, my... oh, my god, we did it!oh, my god.team p thinksthey've got the w,but this one isgoing to the judges.all three are formerbattlebots participants.derek young, jasonbardis, lisa winter.once again, it's an point scoringsystem for the battlebots judges.they could award up to fivepoints in the damage category,three for aggressionand three for control.so, kenny, how didyou see it play out?well, leanne toldus she was worried about pgetting underneath herrobot and boy, was she right?because that proved to bevalkyrie's kryptonite in this match.p used its speed and lowprofile to repeatedly upend valkyrieand dictate the action.p did suffer some damagein the process, though, losing a wheeland taking a flurry of shotsto its lifter and top armor.but eventually, it was ableto break valkyrie's weapon,which was brandon zalinsky'sgoal from the very start.that's right, and that'swhere things could get interestingbecause the most heavily weightedcategory in the damage columnis damage done bya primary weapon.you can argue that valkyriescored points with its spinner,while p did most of hisdirty work with its wedge.but in terms of the eye test,valkyrie flying around the box, the fireit suffered halfway through,you have to imaginep has the leg up here.both bots area little punchdrunkas the final secondsticked away.faruq has the results.let's see which waythe judges chose to go.the results fromthe judges are in.the winner byunanimous decision is...p.p!all right, then, there it is.you can see the excitement andthe relief on the faces of team p,that was a gutsy effort. theirbot's a little worse for wear,but in the end, the judgesawarded the unanimous decisionand they have the coveted start to their season.all right, coming up next, it's thebattle bots debut of the rookie riptide.and there's its opponent,hard to miss inside the test box,it's huge.stick around for the fight.next on battlebots.we continue on with battlebots.next up on the fight card,it's huge versus riptide. in a fieldwidely considered to be the most stackedand most dangerousin battlebots ' history,it's an intimidatingtime to be a rookie.just ask switchback, who wesaw take the l on opening night.historically, new captains struggleto break into the tournament,let alone make itpast the round of .but young captain ethan kurtz is out toprove that he and his bot, riptide, belong.is that bolt tight?my name is ethan kurtz.i am the captain of riptide.riptide is a egg beater spinner.we've been heavilyinspired by yeti.we love yeti's lifters and we alsolove that yeti had a very long, wide drum.we want a huge spinner putting outall the mass on the weapon as possiblefor the best energy transfer.and that's how riptide,kind of, was formed.our biggest strengthis our pound drumthat spins at miles per hour plus.we launched a  poundmedicine ball,  feet in air.we've launched a poundtire  foot into the air.we're just a fan ofbig effing weapons.for a rookie team, we are allreally stoked to get in the battlebotsbecause we reallywanted to be here.we all kind of knew each otherfrom the vex robotics competition.we all wanted to dosomething together.battlebots was the hardestthing we could think of.my father is on the team.he's experienced with, like,radios and rc planes in the old days,so he knows howto troubleshoot things,he's been really,really helpful.being captain, absolutelythrilled, and this is a lifelong dream.i'm just really, really excited.i just wanna get outthere and hit something.riptide now just momentsaway from making its debuton the big stage.and when ethan found out thathe was gonna be on battlebots,he said it was adream come true.but he may be facing awelcometothebigleagues moment hereas he takes on huge, captained by,a very motivated, jonathan schultz.he's coming off arather disappointingand often frustrating season,but this is still a verydangerous robot, kenny.that's right. and,you know, the interesting thingfor me here is thatjust a short time ago,it was huge that wasthe untested rookiewith something to prove.but after three seasons, thisrobot has been around the block.they know what it takes to win.and i think the team's experienceshould be the difference makerin this match up.faruq, take it away.in the red square, fromsouth windsor, connecticut,the bot's so big, it gaveshaquille o'neal nightmares.it's huge!all right. here we go.the iconic big wheels of huge.kenny, will this be the year huge putsit all together and makes a deep run?well, listen, jonathantells us the motor on the weaponis twice as powerful,much more reliable.he's ready to putlast season behind him,and he's gottalove this matchup.riptide is low to the ground and rightin the sweet spot for huge's weapon.in the blue square,from tarzana, california,keep out, this wateris not fine at all.it's riptide!and there we getour first live look at riptide.you can see the overallexcitement from this squad.ethan told us, he didn'tsleep a wink last night.so, the question here iscan he shake off the nervesand steal a win, kenny?hey, anything is possible.they've added a wedge totry and mitigate some big hits.and riptide has that egg beaterstyle weapon that spins up quickly.this is a bot designedfor aggression.the big question,will ethan hesitateor will he put thepedal to the metal?against huge,our strategy is just to be fullaggressive, full on yeti pounding.we're thinking that wecould spin up faster than them,box rush them and keep them fromactually spinning up their weapon.the only thing that we couldreally hit and actually, you know,grab into is their weapon.their wheel is ably, andthey're really hard to get bite on.when we first learned thatwe're going against huge,we're like, this is ourcounter, why huge?but we're gonna do our bestand we're gonna give it our all,and it's gonna be a great fight.he's the type of robot thatwe think we like to fight.he's very low, hisweapon's pretty low,and we know that it's gonnatake a lot of work for himto really get high enoughto actually damagesome of the moreimportant parts of our robot.i like the chances, but i'm nevergonna say, we're gonna win a fight.we want this season to go wellbecause we want it to show thatlast season was a fluke for us and get backto the level of performance that we used to.big test forthe rookie here, kenny.hey, no pressure, right?just your battlebots debut againsthuge in front of a pumped up vegas crowd.let it ride, riptide.let the bot battle begin.and, oh, the box rush bythe rookie, getting under huge.oh! my goodness.let's go!a ridiculous shot by riptide.and now pushing hugeinto the screws as well.oh, i think, hewedged him in there, chris.is huge stuck?the little screw shouldactually reverse...i gotta see him get out.it should, but jonathanschultz is getting a warning from the ref.and i'm not sure, he can get outof there without some help, chris.and now look at this, riptideis leaning on those big wheelsand there goes the screws.can huge escape?ten seconds, back off.wow!the ref instructing ethan kurtz tostop corralling and get out of there, kid.huge just floundering.those plastic wheels,they can't get any traction.and here comes the countdown!huge just has a fewseconds left to get out of there. can he do it? five, four... it's so close. three...two, one. that's a knock out.that is a knockout. the rookie riptide.what a huge upset.kenny, talk about a rookiemaking a statement out of the gate?yeah, this was unbelievable.i mean, the knockoutshot basically,happened right at the start,got some chips off of huge.look at that shot.i mean, that is someserious power right there.and ethan kurtz followed itup by pushing huge into the screws,that big old uhmw wheel gothung up and that was all she wrote.riptide with the upset.ethan, can you hear us?i hear you. yeah!i just killed my throat.ethan, what is pumping throughyour veins right now, my man?our weapon is freaking powerful.that's what's runningthrough my veins!is this better than youcould have dreamt?oh, yeah, we thought they were just gonnaspin down and smash our weapon to bits.we did not actually expectthem to spin up towards us,which is actually,exactly, what we wanted.we didn't think theywere going to do that.hey, ethan, i knowyou're a rookie... yeah.and you've only had aminute's worth of fight in battlebots,but are you a contender?yes.hell, yes.hell, yes.hey, you're your pop stan isbehind you, bring him up here. bring pops up here. hey, stan. yeah.how proud are you of your son?i couldn't be more proud.this is, it's amazing.he's a, he's an amazing guy andit's just amazing to see him do thisand perform like thisat battlebots. amazing.did you almost shed a tear?ah, i'm about to nowthat you're asking.during the fight,absolutely not.all right. well, guys, congratulationson your first ever battlebots victory.thank you.an incredible debut fromthe new master of hype, ethan kurtz.and if you're jonathanschultz, you just chalk it up to,kind of, bad luck thatyou got stuck back there.i mean, really, he wanted atleast two or a full three minutesin order to gauge how thisbot was going to run in .yeah, what anunfortunate start for huge,especially coming offsuch a disappointing season.this has to be frustratingfor jonathan schultz, but listen,all you could do is shake it offand we'll see what this team ismade of as the season rolls on.credit to riptide.that's a bigtime win.good job, rook. good job.coming up next, can fusion fusehis saw with his opponent's faceor will cobalt stealhimself a victory?and later, in our main event, a lot ofvegas gamblers would call these two botsoddson favorites for a topseed in this year's tournament.it's copperhead and lockjawexchanging bites tonight.they're gonnabe a very tough battle for me.it's gonna be muchmore of a bloodbath.i don't think, he's gonna,wanna go weapon to weapon.that's what we'regonna want to do.we continue here on battlebots.and up next, cobalt makesits return to the battlebotsagainst none other thanreese ewert and fusion.and there he is, the youngestmember of the famed ewert clan,the first familyof robot combat,working on, whatis a technologically,ambitious fusion withits dual primary weapons.reese, obviously, has a lotof outside pressure on him.the expectationsof the family name,being overshadowed by hisolder brother, jake and hydra,last year's numberone tournament seed.but leaving all thatlegacy talk aside,reese is running a botthat just hasn't been ableto string togethersuccessful fights.last season, i calledit the fusion confusion.it seemed, like, i didn't knowwhat was, what it wanted to do.when it worked,it looked promising.when it didn't, well,it basically exploded.and that inconsistency left abitter taste in reese's mouth.in the off season, he shippedout the bot speed controllersto the manufacturer, hopingto put an end to the fire issue.but the jury's out onwhether it's been resolved.that unpredictabilitycauses a lot of stress.but as we know, if he can getthe technical issues under control,this bot has the abilityto hang with the best.you know, there's a wholelot of talent in the ewert gene pool.fusion, certainly a bot tokeep your eye on in ,especially, if they can take downa very tough opening opponent.so, listen, i needyou to humor meand follow along withthis story of cobalt.it used to be owned by a pairof brits, dave moulds, sam smith,they both recentlybecame fathers.congratulations, by the way.that means theycouldn't be here.so, what they did is theysold cobalt to john mladenik.he, of course, is thecaptain of gigabyte.he's got his own robot to run.so, he called hisbuddy, brent rieker,who used to be on team gigabyte.he said, sure, i'm notgonna drive the thing, though.so, they got theirbuddy matt maxham.he's gonna drive cobalt, who'sbeen so excited about this robot.he's called john mladenik, whoonce again is the captain of gigabyte,and he said, i'm so excited.i'm so excitedabout this robot.you probablydon't understand it.all you need to knowis this is one bad bot.yeah, chris, cobalt is vicious.i still remember itripping the face off of duck!a few years ago.one way or another, thevast majority of its fightshave ended in a knockout.it's had a ton ofinternational success.and many consider this tobe a top five bot in the world.with a driver like mattmaxham at the controls,cobalt's sawlike verticalspinner has horror show potential.it's an absolute killer.can't wait to see what it does.it's all coming yourway right now, faruq.in the red square frompleasant garden, north carolina,he came, he saw, he sawed.it's cobalt!the mad man, mattmaxham, pushing in cobalt there,making its return to battlebots.this team, awfully eagerto get a fight under their beltwith this robot, kenny.that's right. and theywanna bring cobalt back with a bang.you can see it hasthat compact design,and the vertical spinnerhas some nasty edges.and for this fight, they'vewelded on a central fork to tryand jam up fusion's weaponsthat could be a difference maker.in the blue square fromdorchester, wisconsin,the ambidextrousassassin, it's fusion!wow, a lot offusion fans in the house.reese says, he's gunningfor the giant nut this year.but fusion simply has toget out of its own way, kenny.they think they'vegot the flameout's handle,but the paranoiais still very real.i've always said, ifthey can stay aliveand keep both of thoseprimary weapons active,this is one of the mostdangerous bots in the game today.well, i've got a fireextinguisher under our desk, just in case.we're a little bitcautious about this one.you can prepare fora horizontal spinneror you can preparefor a vertical spinner.but they're both.it's harder to preparefor somebody that can,that can attack youin two different ways.the strategy is not toget caught in the corner.if we can keep themfrom getting under us,i think we can win this fight.i am incredibly tired oflosing for team whyachi.matt is a pretty good driver.he's... he's a veteran.he's been around for  years.he's currently working on acontraption in the welding tent to tryand beat my horizontal.he leaves me no optionbut to go at him with the vert,get him flipped overand then tailwhip himwith my... my horizontaland rip into him.robots, activate.listen to this crowd,they are ready for a brawl.will reese ewert add anotherchapter to the storied historyof the whyachi clan?or will cobalt throwthe book in a blender?the fight whenbattlebots continues.we are right back intothe action here on battlebots.fusion and cobalt are on acollision course inside the box.both teams hyperfocusedon getting their first victory.matt maxham on the sticksfor cobalt, reese ewert for fusion,game faces securely on.yeah, chris, i don't thinkthese two smile in family photos.couple of warriors here.red team, ready?you think matt's tensed now?you gotta see him do his taxes.blue team, ready?let the bot battle begin!slow and steady,out of the square.oh, nice pop by fusionwith the vertical spinner.the weapon to weaponhit. oh, fusion by fusion.oh, gosh, doescobalt wants a war?yes, it does.matt maxhamis just throwing cobaltinto that verticalspinner on fusion, chris.so far, it's cobalt gettingthe worst of these exchanges.another big shotdelivered by reese ewert,whose bot has yetto catch on fire, kenny.i call that a massive progress.whoa!  whoa!uhoh! but how longcan fusion keep this up?i guess there's your answer.geez!i keep waiting forfusion to go up in flames,but it is looking rocksolid here, kenny.wow!oh!oh, cobalt's flopping around likea fish, and it has come to a dead stop.fusion has rippedthe front of cobalt to shreds.look at that damage.ten, nine...and here comes the countdown.eight, seven.a frustrated mattmaxham can only watchas fusion willcelebrate its victory.two, one.that's a knock out.you did good.we just couldn't get under it.so, after a rookie seasonplagued by technical issues,reese ewert comesout here tonight,runs both of fusion's weapons for theentire match and absolutely dominates.seems like they gotit all figured out this season.my goodness, thatthing was hitting so hard.look at that.and, kenny, onthe flip side of things,matt maxham seemed determinedto send cobalt right at fusionand settle thingsweapon to weapon.do you think thatwas a good strategy?well, no, not afterthose first few impacts.i actually think the extensionthey added to cobalt's front wedge,prevented it fromwinning those exchanges,but matt kept on mashing thecontrols and begging for more contact.be careful what youwish for, i guess.hey, yeah, reese, bringthe whole clan in, why not?that's the way fusion issupposed to work, right?that's how it'ssupposed to work.i think we got thatconfusion figured out.he said that, itwasn't me, i swear.that was kenny, bythe way that said it.i'll hold that againstyou for quite a while.yeah, exactly.well, you got it allfigured out, man.that thing washitting and hitting hard.and guess what?you didn't burn up.that's right. that'sthe best thing, uh.that's all you can ask for,really, it's not burning up.you seem calm,cool and collected.were you this confidentheading into this fight?eh...i've seen some fires testingat home before we came here,but i did some tuning on it and i wasthe most confident i've ever been in that.so.  wow.hey, reese, throughone fight this season,you have a better recordthan your older brother. what's that mean to you? that's right.yeah, i'd like to welcome jakeback to battlebots this year.i think he deserves an award.um, you know, being the mosthated man on television at a timewhen donald trumpwas on television.all right, reese, thoseimprov classes you tookduring the off seasonare really paying off. thank you. all right, dude.congratulations. job well done.he's so good.all right, we startedoff this fight kind of poking funat resee ewert andfusion, by the way,that was you that hewas upset with, not me.i almost forgot.yeah, but it was nice tonot see the bot catch on fireand to do what itwas supposed to do.that's right. listen, theyhad high hopes for it last season.they were hopingthat it would do just that.um, but again, when you'rebringing in new technology,it could take alittle bit of time.it's all coming togetherright now for them.all right. so, are you backpedalinga little bit? are you trying to step offwhat you were saying earlier?i'm on team fusionnow. no, no confusion.i'm on, i'm on team fusion.you just want some of theproceeds from the tshirt sales.that's all.coming up next, will blackdragon be too hot to handleor will icewavebe too cold to hold?and later tonight inour monster main event,copperhead willcollide with lockjaw.there's captaindonald hutson and...oh, hey, get alittle snake bite.donald's doing all the foreshadowingfor us as he gears up for his boutwith last season'snumber three overall seed.the sparks keep flyingwhen we return on battlebots.we are back on battlebots and up next, wewelcome back one of the four semifinalistsfrom the  season, blackdragon, now captained by gabriel maia.how tough is this robot?last season inone of its fights,it was on fire for twominutes and won the match.black dragon.that is one nasty bot.and, chris, we sawtheir fellow countrymen, minotaur,survive an infernoon opening night.there's somethingin the water in brazil.they're building botsas durable as they come.uh, it's been a while since we'veseen icewave in fulltime competition.last year, they participatedjust as a bounty finalist.so, marc devidts, welcomeback for the first time since .kenny, some might callicewave past its prime.i ain't one of them.no one looks forwardto fighting this robot.it can stillchop through concrete.so yeah, i'd be alittle hesitant, too.listen, this bot is from anotherera and in many respects,the sport hastechnologically caught upand even flown right past them,but just like any legend inthe twilight of their career,ice wave has a wealth ofexperience on its side to its credit,mark has rebuilt icewavefrom the ground upand the dude's a robot wizard,so i am not sleeping on this bot.let's send it over to faruq.in the red square, this bot is abrazilian sporting legend like pele.he's always down for therumble, always up for the melee.he gets a kickout of torturing youand taking your soul and winningthe giant nut is his only team'sgoal!it's black dragon!oh, yeah.you hear the crowd, black dragonwon over a lot of fans last seasonwith that unforgettablequarterfinal win over ribbotand now a brandnewcaptain is soaking it all in.that's right,gabriel maia now at the helmand he's got his eyeson the finals this season.black dragon has a ton ofwedge combinations and of course,that heavy egg beater drum.in the blue square, facing off withthis bot, that's the path you've chosen?this thing's so cold,it's practically frozen.but there's no anna orelsa or olaf on this showwhen he holds your life in hishands and decides to let it go.give it up for icewave!marc devidts, ah,carrying his little daughter with him.truly a family affair.kenny, icewave is like a car,like same car, but newer model.this thing looks pretty cool.no doubt, very slick.looks brand new, but there'sa couple of familiar thingsthat deadly pound bladethat spins  miles an hourand icewave still roars.it's a pleasure to face icewave.uh, as you said, it's a legend andone of the most destructive ones ever.i will run after icewave.i'll go search for him.i'll not let them, uh, accelerate,spin up the bar, so i'll keep pushingand i'll try to get the center of thearena so i don't get into surprises.it's a littleintimidating, coming in,having not fought for a fewyears in the full tournament,then getting thrown up againstone of the best teams from last year.i'm worried about a headtoheadhit with their weapon against oursbecause i think ourswon't fare so well.theirs is really thick.that's going to start chippingpieces off of our blade.but if we can hit anywhereelse, i think we'll be good.robots, activate.black dragon lookingmenacing inside the boxand now they've got a chanceto shut down an icon in icewave.for more on icewave, let'scheck in with former editor,current analystand forever genius,the bot whisperer,pete abrahamson.all right, pete, tell uswhat separates icewavefrom the other robots out there?well, the biggest deal ishidden underneath that box.what's under there is aninternal combustion enginetaken out of anemergency rescue zone.now, a few seasons back, theywere using the actual whole sawand all pieces to it.now, what they've done,over the years as it's evolved,and the only thing leftis this cylinder head.all the rest of this hasbeen completely remachinedand redesigned tobe a far more efficient,easier to start, morereliable, icewave.thank you, pete.so that's what's under the hood.and kenny, i love hearingthe sound that this thing makeswhen it starts cranking up.yeah, it is a veryintimidating sound, for sure.all right, here we go.red team, ready?all right, nicemoves from the brazilians.this team's alreadyin the groove.blue team, ready?let the bot battle begin.and here's the black dragondelivering his shot to icewave.what a dangerousstart to this fight. my goodness.black dragon smotheringicewave now, taking it for a ride.wow!and this is big time troublefor mark devidts's icewave.its engine is roaring, kenny, and thereis no action, whatsoever from that blade.our parts are rippin'.the chain or belt or something.yeah, i think black dragonmay have knocked icewave's weaponout of commission inthat first exchange, chris.and the braziliansare not backing down.they want to finish the job.nice putt there as black dragondrives icewave into the short corner.can mark devidts finda way to turn the tide?oh!another shot from blackdragon and now the pulverizeradding insult to injury as well.icewave is drowning, chris.ten, nine...the referees agree, andthe countdown has officially started.six, five.yeah, their primaryweapon has been shut downand the robot has been shut out.one!that's a knock out!black dragon, fastout of the gate here in .kenny, when a box rushgoes your direction, man,it can totally change a fight.yeah, that's right. black dragonwasted no time going right at icewaveand they just never let upgetting underneath them there,take 'em for a ridearound the battlebox,getting them to slam into wallsand it was pretty muchall black dragon here.well, icewave'sblade huffed and it puffed,but it just wouldn'tstart up again.that's right, black dragonbasically broke icewave's armsin the first  secondsof a would be fist fight,then left it huddledin the corner.brutal.and there's thepulverizer exclamation pointon a dominant performanceby the brazilians.thank you guys.thank you. thank you.well, kenny, that is astatement by a semifinalistfrom the  season.this black dragon squadis a lot of fun to watch.the crowd loves them.they got cool dancemoves and they just said,sorry to spoil your bigtimereturn, icewave, but remember us?we're back!and for icewave.you took your licks.now, it's all aboutbouncing back.coming up, the quack is back.hal rucker and duck!return to the boxfor a matchup with runner up,witch doctor.that's next on battlebots.we are back on battlebotsand we've got aspicy one for you.kenny, let's start with witchdoctor and andrea and mike gellatly.they admitted that after theyfinished runner up in ,they were feelingthe pressure in and it kind of showed. one intwo during the regular seasonworked their way into the roundof  where they won a match,but they bowed outin the round of .they said, this year,nobody's gunning for us.i ain't buying that,kenny, are you?neither am i. they'rea legendary team.they've beenaround for a long time.they're very well respected.they are always dangerous.and listen, despitebeing an old school bot,witch doctor has adaptedand evolved with the sportand the resultsspeak for themselves.they were a title favorite and everyteam will keep a close eye on them.and that includesduck! engineered by hal rucker.he's looking to shake offthe ring rust and as he told us,he's not sure if adefensiveminded bot can keep pacewith this year's deadly lineup.i'll tell you what, if i'm facinga bump like witch doctor,i want to be verydefensively sound.that's what hal rucker and duck!are all about is don't die,survive, be more durable.and as you can see, they'vegot the new duck! bill lifter.hal wants to controlthis fight and use the lifter,both to mitigateheavy weapon shotsand to hopefully,put witch doctorin some precariousspots inside the box.it's going to be a battle.faruq, take it away.in the red square.it wasn't dr. kevorkianand it wasn't dr. seuss.when you ask me who thekiller is, you have to tell the truth.it wasn't dr. zhivagoor dr. frasier cranewhen they ask, witchdoctor killed you?say, yep, mmhmm.that's the name,it's witch doctor!oh, a standingovation for the  runner upandera and mike gellatlyand team witch doctor.the people still love them.and, kenny, it's hard not toexpect big things from this robot.they are alwaysin final boss mode.that's right, even last season,they followed an early tournamentexit up with a spectacular bounty win.this team isunrelentingly aggressiveand mike's one of thebest drivers in this sport.in the blue square,brace yourself, y'all,it's about to get spooky.this thing is a murderer,something straight out of a movie.imagine a scene, you wake upin a dark room, mouth taped shut.you can feel the impending doom.suddenly, thekiller's behind you.you feel his breath on your backand you know your daywhen you hear the... quack.give it up for duck!duck!, afan favorite as well,participating for the firsttime since the  season.listen to the crowd.and look atthose forks on duck!.chris, we know we won'tget a lot of offense out of duck!but hal is a master of,what i call, the ugly fight.he wants to take witch doctor'sbest shots like he's rocky balboaand score enough points withthe judges to steal a victory.uh, we've madesome pretty big changesto our weapons system this year.we switched to adifferent material,uh, for the discs, to get awayfrom the issue we had last year,we've made some changesto the weapon motors,so we'll have tosee if that's reliable.so, this is going tobe a really big test.and really important forus to win this first match.we noticed that they have somereally, really big forks on the robot.we're not going to beable to outfork them,so, we've actually decided notto use the ground scraping forks.and we're going to usemaneuverability to our advantage.hopefully, they're not usedto driving with their forksand they get a little bit hung upand that's just the opening we need.this year's version ofduck! is completely new.uh, it's  percentbrushless motors.uh, we got rid of theplow that we had last yearand we now have a lifterthat works like a real duckbill.in previous seasons, we've beenknown as the robot that's hard to kill.we just keep going.we've had our weapon ripped offand eventually, won thematch because we just endured.we've kept that durability.that's our main feature.we're hard to kill.i think we might have a shot.robots, activate.the immovable object, duck!the unstoppableforce, witch doctor,here we go.let the bot battle begin!nice and easy,out of the squares,witch doctor's weaponup to full speed.oh!oh, witch doctor lands a shot,it rips the fork clean off ofduck! that was impressive.that was a beautifulhit there by witch doctor.it's trying to go afterthe other one, chris.witch doctor scores some seriousdamage points and there's another shot.mike gellatly all over duck!here in the early going.nothing like a deliciousappetizer of duck! tires.oh.witch doctor punchesduck! across the box.and there's hal rucker with acounter shot straight to the weaponof witch doctor.in seasons past,we've referred to duck!'s strategyas break yourfist with my face,and that's hal rucker'spath to success here again.he just wants todirty up this fight.and speak of the devil, kenny,it looks like witchdoctor's primary weaponis creeping to a stop.has duck! done it?it looks like it may have,and that is bad newsfor witch doctor, chris.this is exactly what halrucker was looking for.okay, so aminute into this fightand duck! hasflipped the script here.it can now go to work withoutfear of getting chewed upby witch doctor's main weapon.yeah, and it's turning intoa pushing match right now, chris.they've come down towho the more powerful bot is.you see it there,the bots lock horns.and how about this,duck! driving witch doctorinto the screwsof the upper deck?witch doctor is like, heyback off me, pal or hal.hal rucker's duck!, showing someeffective control in this sequencethat will count big time.this is going to comedown to a battle of the drivetrainsof these two robots, chris, which oneis going to exert its grill on the otherand control the actionfrom here on out.witch doctor has now goneabout a minute without its weapon.so now trying towin the ground gameand utilize the battleboxto its advantage?oh, nice strike bywitch doctor with the pulverizer.oh, another.those shots fromthe hazards are so importantin fights like these wherethe bots are grinding it outand trying to show every bit ofcontrol that they can, kenny florian.and that can helpas far as damage as well.i'm impressed that withjust one fork, their duck!is still able to getunderneath witch doctor.but look at that, that's what i'mtalking about the power in that drivetrainfrom witch doctor. they saidthey're gonna be more powerfuland you could seeit straight away.thirty secondsremaining in this one,precious time toscore a knockoutor impress thejudges is ticking away.witch doctor has reallyturned it on here down the stretch, chris.they are the faster robot, themore powerful robot putting duck!on its heels now pushingthem around the battlebox.under ten to go. thisone is going to the judges,witch doctor bidding duck!to close out the action.kenny, duck!lives up to its reputationand goes a full three minutes withone of the games heaviest hitters.the duck! don't die.the judges might like it, chris.and we'll have the decisionafter a break, here on battlebots.we are back on battlebotsand as the judges tally up theirscorecards after a three minute slugfestbetween witch doctorand the mighty duck!,let's take a look at the replay.kenny early on, witchdoctor had everything working,yeah, whichdoctor came out on fireripping that frontfork off of duck!following it up with some hugehits and racking up damage points.but right here outcounteredwith a beautifully placed shotright into witch doctor'sweapon and shut it down.and from there it becamethe kind of ugly duckling fightduck! was looking for.that's right, we had apushing match on our hands.duck! stayed aggressive anddid its best to capitalize, but for me,it was witch doctor thatproved to be the bigger bullyutilizing, what looked like, asuperior drivetrain down the stretch,duck! never could get its lifter inthe mix and mount an offensive,and witch doctorseized control of the fight.let's see whatthe judges thought.here is faruq with the decision.the results fromthe judges are in.the winner byunanimous decision is...witch doctor!andrea and mike, i hate tobreak up the love fest over there,but for the first minute itlooked like witch doctordid exactly whatyou wanted it to do.am i right, andrea?absolutely.our number one objective wasnot to break those weapon disks.and duck! is a tough robot to go upagainst, especially as our first match.so i'm really excited, once theweapon started slowing down...obviously, we don'twant to see that,but i knew something waswrong, so i actually shut it offbecause i thought it wouldlook worse to the judgesto see smoke thanjust a weapon turned off.so i don't know if thathad an effect or not,but we were really preparedfor a judge's decision with duck!because you just can't ko him.you guys showed yourexperience right there.what was the strategy, itseemed like you were goingfor the forks early as well?yeah, i mean, that'sobviously, duck!'s strategyto get under us with his fork.so and they're nice andlong and nice and tall,so we're hoping we'dbe able to disable those.and, you know, obviouslyhe's got three other nice,chewy sides thatwe were going for,but the weapon onlylasted about a minute.so, we weren't able toreally get a ton of hits on him.but what we did, ithink, looked pretty good.andrea, you are a fan favorite.your fans want to know, is this arobot that can win the giant nut?i couldn't hear the question.over the clapping.well, that's whathappens, you're so popular,you can't even hear. i asked...see, they still loveyou, they love you.your fans want to know, is this robotreliable enough to win the giant nut?you know, teething issuesis not new for our team.we are experts atrecovering, and duck!is as much of a fanfavorite as we are.so i know either way, this matchwent, we were letting some people down,but we feel a lot of pressure to ourfans to not let them down this year.stay classy, witch doctor.you're off to start. congratulations.thank you.so, this one endsup closer than expected,but witch doctor isin the win column.and for hal ruckerand duck! a tough loss,but great to see themback inside the boxand making a topteam earn every points.okay, folks, we have arrived.up next, our mainevent of the evening,the venomous vehicle copperhead,now under new captainskimberly and robert cowan,takes on lockjaw led bybattlebots og donald hutson.it's lockjaw!coming back to battlebotsafter all these years...donald hutson, the legend.it still makes me nervous,kind of gives a littleshortness of breath.you can just hear the soundof that beep, beep, beep.and your blood pressure goes up.all of a sudden, it's all gone.it's all quiet.all you think aboutis driving the robot.and so, try and take 'em out.whoa!what a shot.this is going to be atough, tough tournament.oh, no mercy from lockjaw.we're gonna haveto fight for this championshipthere's no doubt.it's copperhead.last year was a goodseason until it wasn't.first three fights, wehad some good knockouts.oh, what a shot.an unbelievableperformance by copperhead.and then going into thefinals, we just kind of lost it.this is a monumental upset.we've always beenplagued with drive issues,so we completely strippedout the drive, rebuilt the drive.we have this frame that's oneinch thick, hard aux, but then inside,it's all really modern brushlesstechnology and very high tech stuff.this year, things aregonna go a lot better.robots, activate.going into our fightagainst lockjaw,what we're really looking todo is try and outdrive them,and that is obviouslya very tall taskbecause it's donaldhutson, the legend.unbelievable,the driving by donald hutson.he is ruthless.bot to bot, i think, ultimately,we do have a betterbot than he has.but we're gonna haveto be on our game.i think, i have a more powerfulweapon that spins up a lot faster.we're gonna tryand out drive themand just get acouple of quick hits.oh, look at that!our strategy... smash.we want to use thatweapon as much as possible.oh, my goodness.the new box configuration isjust kind of squeezed us all down.there's places to be trapped,there's places to be stuck.it's gonna be muchmore of a bloodbath.whoa!a fight filled withmayhem and chaos.i don't think, copperheadis one of the botsthat you want toput in a corner.'cause we got a bigbite right up front.oh, my gosh.i love it!i'm local lasvegas artist, david fay.assemblage art is what ido, metal assemblage art,so it's taking trash andturning it into treasure, i hope.i like to thinkof it as treasure.whoa! i think, a toothjust flew off the shrederator.oh, shrapnel allover the battlebox.what i'm doing is i'mtaking the wreckage from these fightsand i'm creating the sculpture thatwe can then auction off for charity.my thoughts and ideasare to build this trojan horsebecause it's the hidden competitorwithin that's gonna win the battle.this is an amazing experienceand i wanna thank all the buildersfor all their hard work andeverything they put into these robotsto get them into that arena.and i can't wait foryou to see the sculptureand see your partsand pieces in it.and i hope it lives up toyour expectations, guys.we are back on battlebots.are they chanting your name?are you fighting here in vegas?i don't know.how'd you do in vegas,by the way, back in the day? i did well, actually. did you?yeah, it was, it wasoverall pretty good.okay, kenny, itis time for the main eventand this is a heck of a matchup.copperhead, lockjaw twolegitimate giant nut contenders.and let's start with copperhead.zach goff, the captain fromlast year, taking the season off,so turning over the controls to the marriedcouple of robert and kimberly cowan,which makes sense becausecopperhead actually lives in their garage.free loader, by the way.you'll remember, in ,copperhead was great. during the regular season,number three overall seedupset in the round of .but robert said even though wehad a perfect regular season record,there were still plenty ofblemishes with this robot.well, thatshocking loss to mammoth,obviously, still hurts.but as they told us, they'vetaken a lot of the weaknessesout of an alreadyexcellent copperheadand they think they've gota championship level bot.taking out one of the og's of thesport, donald hutson and lockjaw.and it was kind of arough  season.you can hear thefans chant for him.very, very popular robot. donaldcouldn't make it out of the round of .so, did he takean early vacation?of course not.he got right back in thebox and won a bounty.you simply cannotcount this team out ever.the way lockjaw tore throughthe beat up bounty tournamentthat was an artist at work.they want to keep thatmomentum going into this season.donald won a desperado,he's won a bounty.now it's time to put togethera dominant regular seasonand prove that lockjaw isa true giant nut contender.does that firststep start tonight?let's find out. faruq.ladies andgentlemen, are you ready?it's time for the main event.in the red square,this bot may be tiny,but if it manages to land shots,you're going straightout of the park,like that movie, the sandlot.yeah, yeah.this little thing is a beast,winning all of its brawls,so you better jet oryou'll be screaming,you're killing me, smalls.give it up for copperhead!there they are, teamcopperhead, snaked out from head to toe.this is an intimidatingmachine, kenny,and look at thesize of those tires.they're almostas big as the bot.they've even gotthe snake mini bot.a lot of things to loveabout copperhead,but none more thanthat drum spinner.man, is that thing dope.by the way, she's gota real snake around her neck. i was going to say. holy...in the blue square, like aroot canal, he'll bring the pain,he's giving you twoweapons and no novocaine.rocks bots sky highlike there's no gravity,then fills up theirgraves like a cavity.it's lockjaw!you know, kenny, back in ,donald hutson won a battelbotstournament right here in vegas.and from what we've heard, he thinkshe's got a serious shot at another onewith this version of lockjaw.that's right, in , he wasworking out what he calls new bot bugs,but he's taken all thebest aspects of that botand turned it up to a . thatvertical weapon is spinning upto  miles per hourin only a few seconds.the bot is durable.it can drive invertedif it needs to.i can't wait tosee it in action.getting a goodlook at copperhead,and i thought robert'sphilosophy on how to win this fightwas very interesting kenny.well, yeah, imean, listen, he said.all we got to do is hit them as muchas possible, wherever and whenever.forget being technical.go out there andstrike, and strike first.i don't know if it'sthe best strategy,but you gotta love the confidencethey have in their weapon.robots, activate.copperhead flankedby its snake nuisance bots.lockjaw trying to playthe role of mongoose.kenny, a lot of tensionhere in the arena.you can see it on donald's face.he wants this one.red team, ready?i mean, that is amazing.she didn't find that onthe way in today, did she?blue team, ready?i guarantee you the pitsare gonna empty for this one.copperhead, lockjaw.hold on to your lug nuts.let the bot battle begin!lockjaw in pursuitout of the gate.looking to be aggressive, but drivedirectly on top of copperhead here.that's playing withsome serious fire.oh, you can hear those weapons.really grinding up.lockjaw going outthere using its plow there.right against their primaryweapon to copperhead,copperhead getsunderneath, though.yeah, it coulddefinitely do some damageto lockjaw from the underbelly.oh, yes, weapon onweapon, sparks fly.big impact there.lockjaw notbacking down at all.ah! you heard robert cowan andcopperhead saying he wanted to go weaponon a weapon with lockjaw.the dude was not lying.oh, big shot by copperhead.how long can thesetwo weapons last, chris?it feels like we'regonna find out.well, copperhead winningthe battle for low ground so far,lockjaw is absorbingthe punishment.yeah, definitely. seemslike that suspension systemof lockjaw is servingit well right now.i think there's aproblem with...double hit there from copperheadand those forks aregetting messed up.oh, my gosh.we're good, we'regood, we're good.oh, yeah, thatleft fork is bent backward,that left front wheelshanging up for dear lifeand lockjaw is behindthe eight ball now.but suddenly copperheadlooked stunned, too.yeah, that's right.it seems like they might betrying to get some space as wellto try to get thatweapon up to speed.oh, lockjaw is on fire!we have seen thisin seasons past.yeah, he may have toshut down their primary weapon.big hit by copperhead.right in front of us.and now lockjaw is on its head.can it selfright?oh!copperhead says, maybe icould be of some assistancein that department, sir.that fork is really messed up,and they typicallyuse that to selfright,but there's a majorproblem with it right now.copperhead goingto town on lockjaw.that weapon has beendishing out pain since the opening bell.now we know why thecowans were so confident about their bot.under a minute to go.copperhead looking a a little outof control here in the second halfbut continuing toattack and grind away.there's been somemassive hits by both robots here,but no doubt about it, lockjaw showingway, way more wear and tear here.but how about lockjawshows off that powerful drivetrain,just bullying copperheadinto the screws,yeah, donald hutsonan amazing driver doing his bestto hang in there and jamup that primary weapon.i don't think that thing hasstopped spinning for one second.no doubt, it has been a rock.look at lockjaw playing theaggressor down the stretch.oh, a big pop by copperhead.nice recovery by donald hutson.he's done a great job ofresetting and staying aggressiveafter those exchanges.what a fight!and we have got a double deckerbus sandwich to finish off three minutesof back and forthaction here in las vegas.an amazingperformance by both botsand now this onewill go to the judges.kenny, snakesusually lie in wait,but not this one, copperheadwas in attack mode from the jump.well, robert cowan's game planwas to put that drumspinner to work.and my goodness, did hestick to it every time lockjawengaged with its verticalspinner, copperhead was right therefor the weapon on weapon hit.and copperheads certainlygot the better of those exchanges.their weapon neverstopped spinningwhile donald'swent up in flames.that's right, but somehowlockjaw was the more aggressive botin that second half.donald used his rear wedge to try andjam up that weapon throughout the fight,and despite spending a goodportion of the match inverted,donald managed to controlmuch of the action down the stretchas copperhead wasswinging for the fences.wall to wallaction in this main event.let's head over tofaruq with the decision.the results fromthe judges are in.we have a split decision.judge jason scored thebattle for copperhead.judge derek scoredthe battle for lockjaw.judge lisa scored thebattle for the winner...copperhead!robert and kimberly,uh, sigh of relief?yeah, i don't...why couldn't you makethat easier on us, man?you just wouldn't die.you just kept going.were you surprisedthat it was a split decisionbased on what wesaw inside the box? no, no. not at all. why?did you watch the match?i mean, it was backand forth the whole time.so he got hits, we got hitsand just we both kept going.yeah.you said you wantto just stay aggressiveand kind of get rid of being a technicaldriver and just get in their face.are you pretty happywith your performance?um, no. i think anythingthat goes to a split decision,we got to try better sothat we can get a knockout.we need a knockout next time.kimberly?yes.why do you have a realsnake around your neckand your husband'sgot a fake one?'cause i secretly wearthe pants in the familywow.the snake pants.congratulations on yourfirst win as cocaptains.thank you.kenny, it's interesting becauserobert, kimberly cowan felt like, yeah,it should have been a split decision.i don't know. maybe i saw itthrough a different lens here.i thought they were dominant.well, listen, i think the differencewas their primary weapon.they were the oneswho are really doling outmost of the hitsthroughout the fight.their primary weaponnever went down,whereas the primary weaponof lockjaw did go down.so, i thought it was going tobe pretty clear for copperhead.but it was a very exciting fightand lockjaw got somegreat hits in early on.all right, whata stellar night of action.we saw stone cold knockoutsfrom hyper shock and black dragon,while others, likep and copperhead,had to rely on the judgesfor their first victory.but i got to tell you, i thoughtthe headliner, unquestionably,was reese ewert's bot fusion.that's right. i mean, again,you look at their bot last season,they had a ton of problems,a ton of inconsistencies.this time, they were veryconsistent and very dangerous.so, another fun night here atbattlebots. once again for faruq,our bot whisperer, pete,my man, kenny florian,i'm chris rose. we'll see younext time here on battlebots.api.opensubtitles.org is deprecated, pleaseimplement rest api
